# Flashcard Slideshow

A react.js component that iterates through a deck of flashcards in a similar fashion to a slide show. 

- An array of flashcards is called a deck.
- Each flashcard object has a front and a back which are text.
- The middle of the component displays text
and a 'next' button is located at the bottom of the component.
- The component begins by displaying the text on the front of a card.
- When 'next' is clicked, the text of the back of the card is displayed.
- When it is clicked again it moves on to the next card in the array,  
- displaying the front and then back, and then the next card, and so on.
- At the end of the array, it loops back to the first card.
